				<h3>Studio Offerings</h3>
				<p>Piano and Voice lessons are offered throughout the year to best fit the needs of each individual student and family. A typical year of lessons will follow the regular academic calendar with 15 weeks of lessons per semester. </br></br>
					Lesson duration will differ depending on the student. Half-hour lessons are fast-paced and geared toward beginners and youngsters as a way to keep them engaged and actively learning. Forty-Five minute lessons are concentrated but more relaxed and allow for more in-depth study. Sixty minute lessons are for the advanced students who have more literature to study. The appropriate length of lesson will be suggested by the instructor at the initial meeting.
